**1 Introduction**

**1.1 Preface**
DCSA envisions a digitally interconnected container shipping industry. Our mission is to be the de
facto standards body for the industry, setting the technological foundation for interoperable IT
solutions. Together with our member carriers, DCSA creates vendor-neutral, technology-agnostic
standards for IT and non-competitive business practices. By working towards the widespread
adoption of these standards, our aim is to move the industry forward in terms of customer
experience, efficiency, collaboration, innovation, and respect for the environment.

Please refer to the DCSA website, https://dcsa.org/about/ for more information.

The objective of the DCSA Data and Interface Standard program is to strengthen the container
shipping industry’s ability to send and receive data across all parties in the industry. Furthermore,
it aims to enhance inter-carrier cooperation based on shared requirements and to ensure
interoperability by using a shared data language. Ideally, this language will be inspired by
existing standards and aligned with the process definitions put forth in the DCSA Industry
Blueprint.

The standards published by DCSA are technology agnostic. DCSA does not point to the use of
specific vendors’ technologies or systems but relies on open-source, shared requirements for the
industry that can be used by all parties, regardless of their choice of technology.

This chapter describes the purpose, structure and supporting publications of this document.


**1. 2 Purpose**
The DCSA Information Model has been created to organise and catalogue the information being
generated or consumed in connection with the processes described in the DCSA Industry
Blueprint. The information model is also used as a collective term to describe all products that
model data needed to meet the interface requirements. The information model includes a
diagrammatic representation of selected data entities and their relationships with one another.

By standardising the terms used and documenting the related data, the DCSA Information Model
is designed to provide a foundation that can be used in the current interface standardisation
work and for future initiatives. DCSA recognises that there is a variety of standards that exist
today and endeavours to reuse these resources where appropriate within the context of the
container shipping industry. Some of these existing standards are more widely adopted than
others, such as the UN/CEFACT Multimodal Transport Reference Data Model (MMT RDM). It is the
intention of DCSA to constantly evaluate the DCSA Information Model against this and other
standards.

**1. 3 Overview**
The DCSA Information Model has been designed to act as a translator between the information
requirements identified by the business processes mapped in the DCSA Industry Blueprint and the

existing standards for describing reference data relevant to the industry. This helps identify what is
already available and where any potential gaps exist that need further investigation. This is
depicted in Figure 1 along with how the DCSA Information Model interacts with the different
elements.

```

**1. 4 Conformance**
All parties in the container shipping industry are encouraged to implement and follow the data
and interface requirements outlined and specified in this document. The requirements are linked
to the UML version 2.0 diagrams for design requirements as well as the Logical Data Model and
data definitions for information requirements, which must be implemented to conform to the
agreed standards within the DCSA framework.
**1. 5 Supporting publications**

1 DCSA Web glossary
of terms
```
```
This document promotes alignment of terms across all DCSA
stakeholders in the container shipping industry. The glossary is
published on the DCSA website in the context of the DCSA Industry
Blueprint.
```
```
2 DCSA Industry
Blueprint 2202. 2
```
```
This document provides insights into as-is carrier processes. The
DCSA Industry Blueprint comprises processes related to the
movement of a container/equipment from one location to
another, processes that are linked to a shipment/booking,
processes that are considered critical for industry digitisation and
standardisation efforts, and finally processes that are not
considered commercially sensitive or of competitive advantage.

```
3 DCSA Event Naming
Convention 2.2, and
Event Structure
Definitions 2.
```
```
Throughout the years, track and trace solutions have become a
commonly seen service in the container shipping industry.
However, due to misalignment of terminology and ways of
working, each carrier has designed its own events that have been
published on their websites. To align this across the industry, this
document provides a naming convention that sets the standard
for naming as well as understanding customer-facing track and
trace events.

4 DCSA Operational
Vessel Schedules
Definitions 3.

```
This document provides standardised terminology and definitions
with respect to communication of operational deep-sea (inter-
regional) vessel schedules between Vessel Sharing Agreement
(VSA) partners. The purpose is to facilitate standardisation and
accuracy in partner communication and hence reduce the pain-
points that carriers raised in this area. It is understood that not all
VSA’s (or carriers) apply ALL processes, but for the sake of
completeness, the full process definitions are shared with all
members. The purpose is to standardise what and when partners
communicate (and to whom) with respect to operational vessel
schedules and related exception-management. The definitions
and time specifications add context to the vessel schedule
process maps that have been circulated separately to members.

**2 DCSA Information Model 2023 .Q 1**
This chapter describes the terms and data types used in this document.

**2.1 Introduction**
The DCSA Information Model 2023 .Q 1 refers to the collection of artefacts and products that
document and define the reviewed and agreed data standards that must be followed within the
DCSA framework. The adoption of the industry standards in the DCSA Information Model 2023 .Q 1
will help ensure the ongoing standardisation and optimisation of interoperability and data
exchange between the parties in the container shipping industry as well as other stakeholders
working within the industry.

As depicted in the diagram below, the DCSA Information Model 2023 .Q 1 consists of the following
artefacts and products:

- Logical data model: A diagrammatic representation of:
    o^ Data entities and the data attributes that store details about the entities
    o^ The relationships that exist between data entities
    o^ Standardised names of data entities and data attributes, for example, equipment
       versus container; definitions of the entities and attributes are stored as part of the
       metadata for the model.
- Standardised lists of data: This is particularly relevant for reference data entities, through
    which a controlled list of values is recommended to help ensure that the same data are being
    used within and between organisations.
- Data standardisation rules: When a predetermined data value cannot be offered, the data
    standardisation rules can help with the generation of consistent data values that can be
    used.

```
Figure 2 : Overview of the contents of the DCSA Information Model
```

The DCSA Information Model 2023 .Q 1 has been designed to support a shared understanding of
concepts, terms, and rules within the shipping industry. The principles behind the creation of the
model have been to look to the current standards used within the industry and to reuse these
standards where appropriate or propose new ones where a usable standard could not be found.
The key input for the DCSA Information Model 2023 .Q 1 includes:

- DCSA Industry Blueprint: Comprises recommended current-state standards for the processes
    used in container shipping. The terminology used in the Information Model has primarily been
    aligned with the DCSA Industry Blueprint terminology.
- DCSA Web glossary of terms: Definitions of terms used across DCSA in an industry-specific
    language.
- UN/CEFACT models: The Multimodal Transport (MMT) Reference Data Model (RDM) has been
    used as a key resource to help define and standardise entities within the Logical Data Model.
- SME input: Input from the appointed subject matter experts (SMEs) among the DCSA
    members.
- Other Standards: DCSA regularly checks which other relevant standards are being used and
    where possible, will re-use proven standards.

The model deals with industry data at logical and conceptual levels rather than applying physical
naming conventions, configured in, for example physical databased. Therefore, the DCSA
Information Model must be considered as the container shipping industry’s reference data model
helping users of the model to understand how data is generated/consumed as a result of the
execution of industry processes and how these data can be mapped in a logical way.

**2.2 Selected data modelling terms defined**
The table below provides a definition of selected terms used throughout this document and
provides the reader with insight into the meaning of the term and the origin of the definition.
Specific terms and definitions that are indispensable for this document may include alternative or
reproduced definitions from existing standards, or they may be referenced as a shared
understanding within DCSA.

```
Term Definition
```
```
Data Entity An object in a data model (e.g. in The Logical Data Model, Equipment is a
data entity).
```
```
Information Model The information model refers to a collection of artefacts and products
that help define the information that is relevant to the container shipping
industry.
```
```
Logical Data Model A graphical way of representing a data architecture without regard to
the physical implementation or the database management system
involved in storing the data, providing information about the various
entities or the relationships between the entities.
```

```
Term Definition
```
```
Reference Data Reference data is data that defines the set of permissible values to be
used by the data entities. Reference data is typically a class of data
commonly referred to as code tables or look-up tables generally
consisting of three attributes: a code, a name, and a description.
Reference data may be described as any kind of data that is used to
categorise other data.
```
```
Table 2 : Selected data modelling terms
```
**2.3 The DCSA Information Model data types and formats**
For each data attribute, which the Logical Data Model points to, a data type has been selected to
provide additional details that have already been identified. An overview of the different data
types utilised is presented in the table below. When the data type is selected, the reasoning
below is applicable throughout this document.

```
Data type Usage rule
```
```
Text The Text data type stores strings in a variable-length field. Data can consist of
letters, numbers, and symbols. In cases where there is a maximum number of
characters allowed, this will be stated by capturing the maximum numbers of
characters allowed, in brackets, e.g. Text(100) is used when the length of the data
field can vary, up to a maximum of 100 characters.
```
```
Number The Number data type represents a number, potentially decimal, i.e. with digits
after the decimal point.
```

```
Data type Usage rule
```
```
DateTime A DateTime is only meaningful in relation to a specific location. The DateTime
attribute should always be specified as UTC or with a UTC Offset to provide
context as to which time zone (location) the DateTime relates to. If no UTC-
related offset is given, the time is assumed to be in local time.
However, this might result in ambiguity and confusion when used across time
zones or even within the same time zone if the region observes daylight saving
time (DST). If the time is provided in UTC, append a Z directly after the time. Z
(also "Zulu" time zone) is the zone designator for UTC±00:00: ‘YYYY-MM-
DDThh:mm:ssZ’. Negative UTC offsets describe a time zone west of UTC±00:00,
where the time is behind UTC.
For example, Quito is five hours behind UTC, so the time zone designator is
"−05:00". The DateTime ‘2019- 12 - 31T12:00:00-05:00’ and ‘2019- 12 - 31T17:00:00Z’
describe the same point in time in Quito. Positive UTC offsets describe a time
zone east of UTC±00:00, where the time is ahead of UTC. For example, Luanda is
one hour ahead of UTC, so the time zone designator is "+01:00". The DateTime
‘2019- 12 - 31T12:00:00+01:00’ and ‘2 019 - 12 - 31T11:00:00Z’ describe the same point in
time in Luanda. The plus sign must be used for a positive or zero UTC offset, and
a minus sign for a negative UTC offset. Hence the UTC offset −00:00 is not
permitted.
For London, the time zone designator would be +00:00 (not −00:00), and +01:
during daylight saving time.
DateTime format without UTC-related offset (local time): ‘YYYY-MM-
DDThh:mm:ss’.
DateTime format with UTC Offset: ‘YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss±hh:mm’.
DateTime format in UTC: ‘YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ’.
```
```
Boolean The Boolean data type is used to specify a true or false value.
```
```
Table 3 : Data type overview
```
**2.3.1 Attribute naming conventions**
To maintain consistency in the Logical Data Model, certain labels are used repeatedly to make
the meaning of these attributes a bit clearer.

Generally, for entities that hold reference data, the following suffixes will be used:

-^ Code^
-^ Name^
-^ Description^

The table below shows a selection of the labels that certain types of attributes use consistently.


**Format Format usage rule**

Code (For reference data entities) A business code used to uniquely identify each row.
These codes may be recognisable by the business community and therefore
have a business meaning.

Name (For reference data entities) A short description of what the reference data value
is; this is the value that will usually be used in reporting.

Description (For reference data entities) In cases where an addition explanation may be
beneficial, a description may be included.

ID An identifier used to make the model easier to understand and preserve
relationships. These are not real-world business keys but are in some cases
intended to be referenced by the interface standards.

DateTime In the current version of the model, the DateTime suffix and data type is used to
denote instances where only a date needs to be captured and where both the
date and the time needs to be captured. This is to allow for flexibility, given the
variances in how data may be stored by different organisations. If only the date is
captured, the time part will consist of zeros for HH:MM:SS (00:00:00). Note: A UTC-
related offset should not be specified because these are only meaningful in
combination with a time. The date is assumed to be local in relation to the
location the date is referring to.

**3 Logical Data Model**
The Logical Data Model of the DCSA Information Model 2023 .Q 1 is presented at an entity level in
the figure below.

The entities in the Logical Data Model can be split into the following two categories:

1. Entities (light grey)

2. (^) Reference data entities (dark grey)
Figure 3 : Logical Data Model - overview of data entities
The Logical Data Model details the entities and their relationships with one another. An entity is an
object that can have information stored about it, for example, Shipment, Equipment, and
Transport. A relation describes the industry data-related rules between two entities.
In many cases, entity data is generated as unique transactional records, for example, a booking
whose data cannot be predetermined in the same way that reference data can. However, it is


important for DCSA to point to specific formats or conventions that can be followed to avoid
duplicated information (for example, two unique instances of equipment with the same reference
number) or incompatible data formats (for example, conflicting date formats such as 2 March
2010 written as 02/03/2010 versus 2010- 03 - 02). Regarding reference data, a holistic dataset (list
of values) will be described to ensure that the data is accurate and will yield the same results no
matter who uses them. Within each subject area in the subsequent sections, the reference data,
which DCSA recommends, will be cited. In cases where a standard already exists, and it has been
agreed within DCSA to utilise the standard, it will be referenced; otherwise it will be specified
where a new dataset is created.

In general, the Logical Data Model is a work-in-progress model, limited in size by the scope of
each release. Therefore, the model will transform and grow over time and, for example, cover
more breadth per relevant subject area in subsequent releases.


**4 Logical Data Model usage**
The DCSA Information Model 2023 .Q 1 has been designed to act as a translator between the
information requirements identified by the business processes mapped in the DCSA Industry
Blueprint, and the existing standards for describing reference data relevant to the industry. The
model has been built iteratively, with focus being given to certain parts of the model that are
relevant to fulfil track and trace, operational vessel schedule and electronic bill of lading interface
requirements. Therefore, certain sections of the model will be more advanced than others,
although the model has evolved and will continue to evolve over time. The aim of this section is to
highlight the relevant parts of the model that have been developed for specific requirements.

The DCSA Information Model was originally constructed around the requirements for the ability to
track and trace a shipment. Afterwards, it was extended to support an interface to share
Operational Vessel Schedules (OVS) between vessel sharing agreement (VSA) partners. The
model has recently undergone another iteration to support an interface to share bill of lading
information electronically between carriers, shippers, and other potential stakeholders in the
supply chain. These areas will be described further in their own sections.

**4.1 Track and trace (T&T)**
The entities that are needed to fulfil the requirements to be able to track and trace a shipment are
shown in the figure below.

```
Figure 4 : Logical Data Model for track and trace
```

The objective behind the use case of tracking and tracing a shipment is to identify the equipment
and the transportation modes used for moving goods, rather than tracking and tracing the goods
themselves or the contents of the equipment used in fulfilling the shipment.

The key entities are:

- Shipment: Uniquely identifies^ the shipment that needs to be tracked and traced.^
- Equipment: Identifies the equipment(s) used to transport the goods belonging to the
    shipment.
- Transport: Identifies which modes of transport (truck, rail, vessel, or barge) are involved in the
    shipment.
- The three Event (Transport/Shipment/Equipment) entities: ‘Shipment events’ describe actions
    that occurred or have been planned to occur in relation to a booking or transport document,
    such as the booking confirmation. ‘Transport events’ describe the movements of the transport
    instances that are associated with the particular shipment or equipment item. ‘Equipment
    events’ describe the movements of an equipment item as part of the freight transportation.
    The previous sections in this document have outlined these elements.

For tracking and tracing, the primary parties are:

- The sender/receiver (shipper/consignee) of goods wanting to maintain information about the
    goods being transported. The details of these parties are stored in the Shipment entity.
- The main party contracting the movement of the goods, which, from DCSA’s point of view, is
    the ocean carrier. The Carrier entity stores the details of this party.


**4.2**^ **Operational vessel schedules (OVS)**
The entities that are needed to fulfil the requirements of sharing operational vessel schedules are
shown in the figure below:

```
Figure 5 : Logical Data Model for operational vessel schedules
```
In addition to track and trace, the Logical Data Model (LDM) includes a standard of information
relevant for operational vessel schedules. The focus is on container liner long-term and coastal
schedules, i.e. schedules that have a named vessel assigned to them. Although proforma
schedules are not covered by the current release, the LDM has modelled the Service and Service
Proforma entities for completeness and additional context, with the expectation that these will be
further developed in the future. Hence, the Service Proforma entity simply represents the latest
version of the proforma, not accounting for historical amendments. Likewise, VSAs have been
modelled with minimal details to simply provide the context for how the operational vessel
schedules are ultimately related to existing vessel sharing agreements.

The following are currently not in scope:


- Commercial schedules
- Feeder schedules^
- Liner schedules that are not part of VSAs

The model for OVS revolves around vessel-related events. It mainly concerns the vessel operator
(how the shipment in practice is transported from the origin to the destination). This customer-
provider relationship is naturally expressed through products. The transport plans of the products
are modelled by the shipment transport entity which describes how the shipment is routed
through the liner network.

The OVS requirements heavily focus on the transport (journey) subject areas. Although for the
track and trace requirements, the generic transport entities were sufficient, OVS needs additional
details which have been modelled as sub-type entities of Vessel and Voyage.

**4.3**^ **eDocumentation**
The entities that are needed to fulfil the requirements to encompass the documentation process
are shown in the figure below.

```
Figure 6 : Logical Data Model for eDocumentation
```
As part of the B/L standardisation initiative several new entities have been added to the IM to
encompass the documentation process (including the Booking process). The purpose is to
enable the process coverage from booking confirmation to issuance of transport document while
capturing all the relevant information details, excluding dangerous goods and out-of-gauge,
from both an operational and a documentation perspective.


The IM has been updated to reflect the relationship between booking, shipment, cargo items,
shipping instruction and transport document, as well as the physical relation between the
container, vessel, and transport plan.

The underlying structure can be described as a layered structure, in which each of the main
process steps amounts to adding an additional layer:

-^ at booking request stage, carried out by the shipper, a Booking is created^
-^ at booking confirmation stage, carried out by the carrier, a Shipment is added, including
    its transport plan^
-^ at shipping instruction stage, carried out by the shipper, the Shipping Instruction layer is
    added^
-^ at Transport Document stage, carried out by the carrier, the Transport Document layer is
    added^

Even though the Information Model is not intended to cover business logic, the following
consideration should be made: Each of the layers can only be edited in the corresponding process
step. For instance, it should not be possible to edit attributes in the Booking entity using the Shipping
Instruction endpoint.


Parties have been added to capture shipper, consignee and notify parties on a booking,
shipment, and transport document. The model further addresses how individual cargo items are
stuffed into containers in relation to the shipping instruction and respective transport documents.
A many-to-many relation between shipment and transport document is created through cargo
items and shipping instruction. The model encompasses the fact that transport documents, i.e.
Seaway Bill and Bill of Lading, can be issued both physical and digitally (eBL) as well as
negotiable or non-negotiable.

Lastly, the model now aligns with the UN/CEFACT MMT reference data model in terms of defining
shipment in relation to a booking as well as shipment in relation to a transport document
(consignment in UN/CEFACT terms).


**5 Subject areas in the Logical Data Model**
The Logical Data Model is split into subject areas to provide a more focused overview of each
part of the model, as illustrated in the figure below. Each subject area consists of one or more
data entities and the related reference data.

```
Figure 7 : Subject areas in the Logical Data Model
```
In the following sections, each of the subject areas and their relating data entities and data
attributes will be described in the following order:

1.^ Shipment
2.^ Transport Document
3.^ Party
4.^ Charges
5.^ Equipment
6.^ Stuffing
7.^ Location
8.^ Transport


9.^ Events
10. Vessel Sharing Agreement (VSA)
11.^ Service
12.^ Reefer

Within each subject area, an overview of and insight into the reference data values are provided.
Where an existing reference data standard is reused, the source will be stated. Otherwise, an
alternative will be specified. All reference data entities will be described in relation to the subject
areas that they are part of.

**5 .1 Shipment**
The subject area of Shipment contains fifteen entities: Shipment, Booking, Requested Equipment,
Reference Type, References, Receipt / Delivery Type, Cargo Movement Type, Value Added Service,
Value Added Service Request, Shipment Cut-Off Times, Cut-Off Times, Incoterms, Payment Term
Type, Commodity and Communication Channel Qualifier. The Shipment related entities are shown
in Figure 8.

The term shipment has been defined in accordance with the DCSA Industry Blueprint and relates
directly to the booking confirmation sent by a carrier to a customer. A shipment is an identifiable
collection of one or more Cargo Items (available to be) transported together from the Seller(s)
(Original Consignor/ Shipper) to the Buyer(s) (Final/ Ultimate Consignees). A shipment may form
a part or all of a transport document (UN/CEFACT’ Consignment) or may be transported in different
transport documents. As such, the definition of a shipment aligns with the UN/CEFACT MMT
reference data model.


The Shipment subject area and its entities will allow for the identification of the shipment that a
user may want to track. A shipment must be assigned to one and only one carrier (as defined by
the Carrier ID).

```
Figure 8 : Shipment subject area
```
The entities within the Shipment subject area are defined and detailed in the following tables.

**5 .2 Transport Document**
The subject area of Transport Document contains two entities: Shipping Instruction and Transport
Document. These entities are shown in Figure 10. A shipping instruction is an enrichment to the
original booking shared by the shipper to the carrier. The shipping instruction includes cargo items,
specified by volume or weight, packages, etc. The information given by the shipper through the
shipping instruction is the information required to create and update a transport document. A
transport document is a contractual document issued to the shipper which confirms the carrier's
receipt of the cargo, acknowledging goods being shipped or received for shipment and specifying
the terms of delivery (as one of the evidences of the contract of carriage). The Transport Document
is prepared based on shipping instructions, including cargo description, given by the shipper on
forms issued by the carrier and is the title to the goods and can be a negotiable document. It


relates directly to the concept of a consignment as published in the UN/CEFACT MMT reference
data model.

```

The entities within the Transport Document subject area are defined and detailed in the following
tables.

**Transport Document entity:** relates to the type and key attributes of the contract of carriage.

The equipment subject area is modelled to ensure that a specific equipment can be identified and
detailed appropriately in terms of type and size in accordance with ISO 6346:1995 Freight
containers – Coding, identification and marking and amendment 3 (2012) to ISO 6346:1995.
Whenever ISO 6346:1995 is mentioned as a reference in this document, it all instances of equipment
that can be used to fulfil a shipment. Each piece of equipment can be categorised according to its


type and size, and this information is contained in a hierarchy of reference tables based on ISO

6346. The ISO Equipment Code entity brings together reference data regarding equipment size and
type. The entities within the Equipment subject area are defined and detailed in the following
tables.

**Equipment entity:** used for storing cargo in/on during transport. The equipment size/type is
defined by the ISO 6346 code. The most common equipment size/type is 20'/40'/45' Dry Freight
Container, but several different versions exist.

consists of a 4-letter prefix and a 7-digit number
(composed of a 3-letter owner code, a category
identifier, a serial number, and a check-digit). If a
container does not comply with ISO 6346, it is
suggested to follow Recommendation #2: “Container

An area containing several functions (port, train station, airport, etc.) should still only have one UN
Location Code assigned.

**5 .8 Transport**
The subject area of Transport describes a movement of a shipment from origin to destination and
contains nine entities: Transport, Vessel, Mode of Transport, Shipment Transport, Transport Call,
Voyage, Transport Call Voyage, Commercial Voyage and Commercial Voyage Transport Call.
These entities are shown in Figure 20. The Transport subject area is modelled around the key entity
of Transport Call for storing specific instances of transport and a subtype (Vessel), which captures
vessel-specific details. The Transport Call entity is linked to The Mode of Transport. The Mode of
Transport entity describes the possible modes of transport. The DCSA Transport Type attribute has


been added to the Mode of Transport reference data entity to provide shipping industry-specific
terminology rather than more generic terms defined by the UN/CEFACT.

```
Figure 20 : Transport subject area
```
The entities within the Transport subject area are defined and detailed in the following tables.

**Mode of Transport entity:** addresses the code specifying the transport mode for the logistic
transport movement, following the UN/CEFACT Recommendation 19 - Codes for Modes of Transport
mapped to the transport types as defined in the DCSA Web glossary of terms. **Mode of Transport

**5 .9 Events**
The subject area of Events contains eleven entities. Shipment Event, Equipment Event, Transport
Event and Operations Events are the four main entities. The other seven entities are related to the
associated reference data: Event Classifier, Shipment Event Type, Document Type, Empty Indicator,
Equipment Event Type, Transport Event Type and SMDG Delay Reason. These entities are shown in
Figure 22.

The model design relating to the Equipment, Transport and Shipment Events is based on the Event
Structure work that has been published by DCSA. Please refer to the DCSA Event Naming
Convention and Event Structure Definitions to obtain more information about the definitions,
syntax, parameters, and values for the events.

An event occurs in relation to the central entities of Shipment (for example, Shipment Release
Message Issued), Transport (for example, Actual Vessel Departure from Port Terminal), and
Equipment (for example, Actual Gate in of Laden Equipment at Port Terminal). These events have
been documented by the DCSA Event Naming Convention and Event Structure Definitions
supported with DCSA reference data. The Shipment, Transport, Equipment and Operations events
have been modelled separately to keep the logical association of what the specific event relates
to. For example:

-^ All types of events relating to shipment are^ captured in the Shipment Event Type.^
-^ All types of events relating to transport are^ captured in the Transport Event Type.^
-^ All types of events relating to equipment are^ captured in the Equipment Event Type.^
-^ All types of events relating to vessel operations are captured in the Operations Event Type.^
-^ All types of events relating to reefer measurements are captured in the Reefer Event Type.^
-^ All types of events relating to IoT devices^ are captured in the IoT Event Type.^


Each of the above event types can be further related to the estimated, planned, actual or requested
state captured in the Event Classifier entity, and each Event also has specific entities that only
relate to those types of events. For example, Equipment Event is related to the Empty Indicator.

**5 .10 Vessel Sharing Agreement (VSA)**
Vessel sharing agreement is used as an umbrella term to cover the different agreement types
that carriers can have in place. The subject area of a VSA contains four entities: Vessel Sharing
Agreement, Vessel Sharing Agreement Partner, Vessel Sharing Agreement Type and Tradelane.
These entities are shown in Figure 24.

The Vessel Sharing Agreement subject area and its entities will allow for the identification of the
partners in a vessel sharing agreement and which Tradelane the agreement relates to. The
Vessel Sharing Agreement Type entity defines the different types of agreements, and the Vessel
Sharing Agreement is used to outline the specific agreement. The Vessel Sharing Agreement
Partner entity identifies the partners in the agreement. The Tradelane entity indicates which
directional trade the agreement relates to and is linked to the Service entity (described in the
Service subject area) to specify which services are covered in the Tradelane.

```
Figure 24 : VSA subject area
```
The entities within the VSA subject area are defined and detailed in the following tables.

**Vessel Sharing Agreement entity:** describes an agreement between two or more shipping lines to
share vessel capacity on specific trades to increase asset utilisation.

**5 .11 Service**
Services are the central constituents of each carrier’s network. They are typically operated on a
weekly schedule. The Service Proforma entity has been modelled on a reduced scope and only
allows one version (the latest) to be stored at any point in time, with a limited number of details
captured.

The subject area of Service contains two entities: Service and Service Proforma. These entities are
shown in Figure 26.

```
